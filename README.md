## About Project

The code for this application had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn't include any standard accessibility features, and it didn't work offline at all. My task was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

## Project dependencies

This project was written using HTML, Javascript and CSS. 
* [Here You can read about Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Here how to start with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)
* [Here about CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [Downloading Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How to start

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and make start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Version

This is version `1.0` of this application.
